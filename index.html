    <h3>Michelle Obama</h3>
    <h3>In August of 2008, Michelle Obama delivered a speech at the Democratic Convention saying, "The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them."</h3>
    <h3>Shortly after, she would officially assume the role of first lady of the United States, making her the first African American woman to ever do so.</h3>
    <h3>More than a decade later, Kamala Harris wrote her own chapter in the history books when she was inaugurated as the first Black — and female — vice president.</h3>
    <h3>It's trailblazers like Obama and Harris, two awe-inspiring Black women in history, who prove that perseverance and determination can lead to profound change.</h3>
